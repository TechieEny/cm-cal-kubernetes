What is Scheduling?
#######################
Scheduling refers to making sure that Pods are matched to Nodes so that Kubelet can run them

- A scheduler watches for newly created Pods that have no Node assigned. For every Pod that the 
  scheduler discovers, the scheduler becomes responsible for finding the best Node for that Pod 
  to run on. The scheduler reaches this placement decision taking into account the scheduling 
  principles described below.

- Feasible Node: A node that is capable of meeting the demands of a pod. If no feasible nodes are found, pods
                 are not scheduled. Kubernetes runs functions to score the feasible Nodes and picks a 
                 Node with the highest score among the feasible ones to run the Pod.
                 Scoring factors include collective resource requirements, hardware / software / 
                 policy constraints, affinity and anti-affinity specifications, data locality, 
                 inter-workload interference.
- Manually schedule:
                - You set the paramters/factors for a pod to run on a node. This is done through the spec.             

- Default Scheduler: The "Kube Scheduler" runs as a part of the control plan
