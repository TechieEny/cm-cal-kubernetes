Role-based access control (RBAC) is a method of regulating access to 
computer or network resources based on the roles of individual 
users within your organization.

RBAC Objects: Role, ClusterRole, RoleBinding and ClusterRoleBinding

RBAC Role or ClusterRole contains rules that represent a set of permissions. 
Permissions are purely additive (there are no "deny" rules).

- An RBAC Role or ClusterRole contains rules that represent a set of permissions. 
  Permissions are purely additive (there are no "deny" rules).
- A Role always sets permissions within a particular namespace; 
  when you create a Role, you have to specify the namespace it belongs in.
- ClusterRole, by contrast, is a non-namespaced resource

Role: always sets permissions within a particular namespace; when you create a 
      Role, you have to specify the namespace it belongs in

ClusterRole: a non-namespaced resource. ClusterRoles have several uses. You can use a ClusterRole to:
      - define permissions on namespaced resources and be granted within individual namespace(s)
      - define permissions on namespaced resources and be granted across all namespaces
      - define permissions on cluster-scoped resources.

A role binding grants the permissions defined in a role to a user or set of users. 
It holds a list of subjects (users, groups, or service accounts), and a reference 
to the role being granted. A RoleBinding grants permissions within a specific 
namespace whereas a ClusterRoleBinding grants that access cluster-wide.

To grant permissions across a whole cluster, you can use a ClusterRoleBinding. The following 
ClusterRoleBinding allows any user in the group "manager" to read secrets in any namespace.
namespaced resources (like Pods), across all namespaces
